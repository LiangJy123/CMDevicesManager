- **After**: Single background task with proper cancellation support
- **Benefit**: Reduced complexity, better resource management, no deadlock risks

### 3. **Improved Configuration**
- **Before**: Interval-based timing (milliseconds)
- **After**: FPS-based configuration (frames per second)
- **Benefit**: More intuitive configuration for multimedia applications

### 4. **Better Resource Management**
- **Before**: Manual timer disposal and complex cleanup
- **After**: CancellationTokenSource with automatic cleanup
- **Benefit**: Safer disposal, no resource leaks

### 5. **?? Device Disconnection Handling**

- **NEW**: Queue clearing when devices disconnect (prevents stale data)
- **NEW**: Device connectivity monitoring and event reporting
- **NEW**: Intelligent real-time mode management based on device availability
- **Benefit**: Robust handling of device hot-plugging scenarios

### 6. **Maintained Compatibility**
- Kept all original public methods (`QueueJpegData`)
- Preserved all events and event argument types
- No breaking changes for existing code

## Architecture Comparison

### Original Implementation
```
Timer ? SemaphoreSlim ? ProcessQueueCallback ? Complex State Management
```

### New Implementation  
```
Background Task ? Processing Loop ? Device Monitoring ? Frame Rate Control ? Clean State Management
```

## ?? Device Disconnection Features

### Automatic Pause/Resume
The service now automatically pauses when no devices are connected and resumes when devices become available:

```csharp
// Service automatically pauses when ConnectedDeviceCount == 0
// Service automatically resumes when devices connect
```

### Queue Management on Disconnection
When devices disconnect, the service:
- Immediately clears the frame queue to prevent sending stale data
- Drops incoming frames if no devices are connected
- Logs all operations for debugging

### Enhanced Statistics
New statistics include device connectivity information:

```csharp
var stats = service.Statistics;
Console.WriteLine($"Is paused: {stats.IsPaused}");
Console.WriteLine($"Connected devices: {stats.ConnectedDeviceCount}");
```

### Device Connection Events
New event for monitoring device connectivity:

```csharp
service.DeviceConnectionChanged += (s, e) => 
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Device {(e.IsConnected ? "connected" : "disconnected")}: " +
                     $"{e.Device.ProductString} (Total: {e.TotalConnectedDevices})");
};
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage (Unchanged)
```csharp
var service = new RealtimeJpegTransmissionService(hidDeviceService);
service.QueueJpegData(jpegBytes, "metadata");
```

### Advanced Configuration with Device Monitoring (?? Enhanced)
```csharp
var service = new RealtimeJpegTransmissionService(
    hidDeviceService,
    targetFps: 25,                   // 25 FPS (more intuitive than 40ms)
    maxQueueSize: 3,                 // Smaller queue for lower latency
    realtimeTimeoutSeconds: 5        // 5 second timeout (more intuitive than 5000ms)
);

// Monitor device connectivity (NEW)
service.DeviceConnectionChanged += (s, e) => 
{
    if (!e.IsConnected && e.TotalConnectedDevices == 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Service paused - no devices connected");
        // Application can take action, e.g., show UI notification
    }
    else if (e.IsConnected && e.TotalConnectedDevices == 1)  
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Service resumed - device connected");
        // Application can take action, e.g., hide notification
    }
};
```

## Key Features Preserved

### ? Automatic Queue Management
- Queue overflow protection
- Oldest frame dropping
- Statistics tracking
- **?? Queue clearing on device disconnection**

### ? Real-time Mode Control  
- Automatic enable/disable based on activity
- Timeout-based deactivation
- Event notifications
- **?? Prevents enabling when no devices connected**

### ? Comprehensive Statistics
- Frame counts (queued, sent, dropped)
- Success/failure rates
- Current queue status
- Last activity tracking
- **?? Device connectivity status**
- **?? Pause state information**

### ? Event System
- Frame processed notifications
- Frame dropped alerts  
- Real-time mode changes
- Error reporting
- **?? Device connection change events**

### ? Thread Safety
- Interlocked operations for statistics
- Concurrent queue for frame storage
- Safe disposal pattern
- **?? Thread-safe device event handling**

## ?? Device Disconnection Behavior

### When Devices Disconnect:
1. **Immediate Response**: Service detects disconnection via HidDeviceService events
2. **Queue Clearing**: All pending frames are cleared to prevent stale data transmission
3. **Pause State**: Service enters paused state (`IsPaused = true`)
4. **Real-time Mode**: Automatically disabled if no devices remain connected
5. **Frame Rejection**: New frames are immediately rejected with appropriate logging

### When Devices Reconnect:
1. **Automatic Resume**: Service automatically exits pause state
2. **Real-time Mode**: Re-enabled when frames are queued
3. **Normal Operation**: Processing resumes with new frames

### Frame Handling Logic:
```csharp
// Before processing any frame
if (ConnectedDeviceCount == 0)
{
    // Drop frame immediately - no devices to send to
    OnFrameDropped(frame, "No devices connected");
    return;
}

// During processing
if (ConnectedDeviceCount == 0)
{
    // Device disconnected while processing
    OnFrameDropped(frame, "Device disconnected during processing");
    return;
}
```

## Performance Improvements

### 1. **Reduced CPU Usage**
- Single background task vs multiple timer callbacks
- Better frame rate control with adaptive delays
- No busy waiting or excessive locking
- **?? Automatic pause reduces CPU usage when no devices**

### 2. **Lower Memory Pressure**

- Better garbage collection behavior
- **?? Queue clearing prevents memory buildup**

### 3. **Improved Responsiveness**
- Non-blocking queue operations
- Faster real-time mode switching
- More predictable timing behavior
- **?? Immediate response to device connectivity changes**

## Error Handling Enhancements

### 1. **Graceful Degradation**
- Service continues operating after individual frame failures
- Automatic retry through queue system
- Comprehensive error logging
- **?? Robust device disconnection handling**

### 2. **Resource Protection**
- Safe disposal even during active operations
- Timeout protection for blocking operations
- Exception isolation in processing loop
- **?? Safe event unsubscription during disposal**

### 3. **Monitoring & Debugging**
- Clear logging of service lifecycle
- Performance statistics available anytime
- Event-based error notification system
- **?? Device connectivity logging and monitoring**

## Migration Notes

### No Code Changes Required
Existing code will continue to work without modification:

```csharp
// This still works exactly the same
var service = ServiceLocator.GetRealtimeJpegTransmissionService();
service.QueueJpegData(frameData, "MyFrame");
```

### Optional Enhancements for New Code
Take advantage of new device connectivity features:

```csharp
// Enhanced monitoring (optional)
service.DeviceConnectionChanged += HandleDeviceConnectivity;

// Enhanced statistics (optional)  
var stats = service.Statistics;
if (stats.IsPaused)
{
    // Show "No devices connected" UI
}
```
